I love the look and feel of it, and I get complimented on it all the time. If that were the entirety of the story, this would be a 5 star review.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the most important part of this watch, the functionality, has some issues. Despite this being an automatic winding watch, it doesn't always stay wound. I have had days where I had to re-wind it before the end of the day. Most days however, it does last through the day. I just have to wind it and set the time again in the morning. Other mechanical self winding watches I own will in fact not need to be wound again until I stop wearing them for a full day. In addition, I can't always get the spring fully wound before it will start clicking and the spring skips off the winding gear.<br /><br />If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have returned this watch. Unfortunately, I missed the 30 day return window. So now I'm stuck with an only mostly working but beautiful watch. I guess that makes it kinda like a fashion model.

The third page in the manual can be used as a guide to the watch adjustment method.  I found the controls to be simple, everything is controlled by the position of the crown. It can be pulled out into two position, the first position allows change the day of the month, the second position moves the arms.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very attractive classy looking watch.
